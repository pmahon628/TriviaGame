# TriviaGame

This was a homework assignment for UNH coding bootcamp in April of 2019 but I was unsatisfed with the work then and am looking to change the way the quiz looks.

I am changing the work to be a bootstrap, CSS and HTML heavy layout since I would like extra practice working with those pieces. 

Game functionality is being driven by Jquery.
